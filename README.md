# Automated-document-information-extraction-software
The user needed to capture the information on the files kept within the technical Spec folders for Solvency II in an excel based template in order to prepare a summary of existing file information in the folder. This folder had 20+ folders, each having 25+ files within the folder. The manual process of entering file information in the template(approx. 25 to 30 files in each folder) would have been time consuming.

#Solution

Created an automated Algorithmic driven transformation function to populate the file information from the folder into the excel based template.

Now user can extract file information from the entire folder in one go and at the same time have the information saved into the excel based template

User can scan for more than one file in one go in a folder.

#Impact

Time saving,
High accuracy due to less manual intervention,
Additional control checks in the function for quick validation of file extension (File type e.g. Excel, word, PPT)
